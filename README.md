Text Preprocessing Pipeline using Python (Google Colab)
This repository contains a complete and beginner-friendly implementation of a Text Preprocessing Pipeline, created in Google Colab. It covers essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques required to clean and prepare raw text data for machine learning or deep learning models.

📌 Features Included
This project walks through step-by-step preprocessing methods, which include:

🔡 Text Cleaning

Lowercasing

Punctuation removal

Removing special characters and digits

✂️ Tokenization
Breaking down sentences or paragraphs into individual words/tokens.

🛑 Stopword Removal
Eliminating common words (e.g., is, the, and) that do not carry significant meaning.

🌱 Lemmatization and Stemming
Converting words to their base/root form using both NLTK's Porter Stemmer and WordNet Lemmatizer.

📁 Files
Colab Notebook: Contains the full working code with explanations and output examples.

Sample Inputs & Outputs: Demonstrates before and after of each preprocessing step.

🧠 Libraries Used
NLTK - For natural language processing functions

re - Regular expressions for cleaning text

string - For handling punctuation

Pandas (if included) - For working with datasets (optional)

🚀 Getting Started
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-preprocessing-pipeline.git
Step 2: Open the Colab Notebook
You can open the .ipynb file directly in Google Colab.

Run the cells sequentially to observe each preprocessing step.

🎯 Use Cases
Preparing raw text for NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, classification, etc.

Teaching and learning core NLP preprocessing techniques.

Building your own custom NLP pipeline.

🛠️ Future Improvements
Add support for custom stopword lists

Integrate SpaCy for more advanced preprocessing

Extend support for multi-language text cleaning
